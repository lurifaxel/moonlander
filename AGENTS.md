# AGENTS Guidelines for This Repository

This repository contains a game about flying a little spaceshift and landing on the moon in the root of the repository. When working on the project interactively with an agent (e.g. the Codex CLI) please follow the guidelines below so that the development experience continues to work smoothly.

## Docs

The `docs` directory contains instructions for certain actions. When the user asks you to do something, check if it is one of the commands in there. If so, follow the instructions in the relevant file to perform your job up to standard.

## Screenshot Guidelines

- When you change or add functionality, run the game and use the `browser_container.run_playwright_script` tool to capture an up-to-date screenshot of the relevant UI.
- Always include the latest screenshot of new or modified functionality in your final response so reviewers can see the change without running the app themselves.

## Project Structure

- Always ensure there is an up to date description of the project structure in this file, below these bullet points
- The project structure should be displayed as a tree structure, e.g. as generated by the tree CLI-tool. Each directory should also be described shortly
