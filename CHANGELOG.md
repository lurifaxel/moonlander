## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Thruster dust now spawns where the exhaust ray meets the terrain, matching lander tilt.
- Added oversized "Awesome Levels" with pronounced peaks, valleys, and hidden landing pads that require exploration between attempts.
- Start menu with a custom level editor: sculpt (or Alt-carve) voxel terrain, place spawn/landing zones, and press R to flight-test creations—including pads tucked inside caverns—before returning to editing.

### Fixed

- Text after successful landing does not signal restart.

### Changed

- Enlarged and centered the playfield; canvas now scales with the browser up to 1280x720 for a more immersive layout.
