When asked to refactor follow these rules:

- Changes are to be made to improve the structure of the project and the code, in order to increase quality
- The functionality of the app _must not be changed_ when refactoring
- The main goal of refactoring is to improve readability, understandability and testability of the code
- New tests may be introduced when refactoring
