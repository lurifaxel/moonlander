# Feature 0006 - Larger, Centered Playfield For Immersive View

## Context
Increase the Moon Lander playfield size because "it's a pretty small window in my browser that is the playable area" and should become more immersive by expanding the canvas and centering it in the viewport.

## Target files
- `index.html`: enlarge the canvas dimensions, add responsive sizing logic, and adjust layout/CSS so the game centers and scales with the window while keeping HUD overlays functional.
- `README.md`: note the new immersive layout and any controls/testing tips tied to the resize behavior.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: document the playfield presentation upgrade.

## Technical plan
1. **Canvas sizing approach**
   - Replace the fixed `width="600" height="400"` attributes on `#gameCanvas` with dynamic sizing set via script based on the window dimensions, targeting a ~16:9 ratio and capping at 1280×720 while maintaining at least the current 600×400 minimum.
   - Add a function, e.g., `resizeCanvas()`, that computes `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` using `Math.min(window.innerWidth * 0.9, 1280)` and `Math.min(window.innerHeight * 0.9, 720)` and keeps the aspect ratio by sizing height from width (or vice versa) before updating the lander world metrics (`width`, `height`) and any dependent values that currently read from the initial constants.
2. **Respond to window changes**
   - Invoke `resizeCanvas()` on load and attach it to `window.addEventListener('resize', ...)`, throttled if necessary to avoid excessive recalculations, ensuring that render loops reference the updated `canvas.width`/`height` each frame.
   - Audit variables set during initialization (e.g., `const width = canvas.width; const height = canvas.height;`) and convert them to lookups or mutable values so the game logic always uses the latest dimensions without stale snapshots; update terrain generation and physics boundaries to respect the new `width`/`height`.
3. **Layout centering and overflow management**
   - Update body styles to use a flex container (`display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh;`) and remove the global `overflow: hidden` only if it interferes with centering; ensure the HUD (`#info`) remains positioned relative to the viewport or canvas after layout changes.
   - Confirm parallax background tiling still fills the canvas area using the new size and adjust any assumptions about `width`/`height` when drawing.
4. **Verification and documentation**
   - Manually test in the browser by resizing the window to confirm the canvas scales, remains centered, and preserves gameplay physics without clipping.
   - Append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing the immersive canvas/viewport enhancements.

## Notes
- Add the change summary to `CHANGELOG.md` after implementation.
