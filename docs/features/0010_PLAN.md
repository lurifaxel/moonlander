# Feature 0010 - Configurable Meteor Strikes Polish

## Context
Meteor spawning, warnings, and editor tooling are live, but keyboard-driven tweaks in the editor fall out of sync with the meteor panel. Designers can press the hotkeys to adjust size, speed, warning lead, or arrival time, yet the DOM controls do not refresh and warning lead values can exceed the arrival time. This pass keeps keyboard shortcuts, pending-meteor previews, and exported data consistent.

## Target files & touch points
- `index.html`
  - Share a single timing clamp for selected, default, and pending meteors.
  - Refresh editor overlays after keyboard adjustments so the numeric inputs mirror the latest values.
  - Flag meteor edits as dirty so canvas previews update immediately.

## Technical plan
1. **Centralise meteor timing clamps** – Add a helper (e.g. `clampMeteorTiming(def)`) that enforces `warningLeadMs <= startMs` plus existing radius/speed limits. Call it from `adjustSelectedMeteor`, default adjustments, and timeline normalisation so both keyboard and input edits stay bounded.
2. **Synchronise keyboard edits with the panel** – When meteor hotkeys change a selection or the defaults, call the clamp helper, mark `terrain.dirtyRender = true`, refresh any `editorState.pendingMeteor`, and trigger `updateEditorOverlay()` so the panel reflects the new values instantly.
3. **Propagate updates to pending previews** – Ensure pending meteors inherit the clamped defaults and that selection edits nudge `editorState.pendingMeteor` when appropriate, keeping the on-canvas guides accurate while dragging or before confirming placement.

## Notes
- No changelog entry is required; this is polish on an existing feature.
