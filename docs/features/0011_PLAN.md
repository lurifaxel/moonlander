# Feature 0011 - Mobile Touch Controls Overlay

## Context
The Moon Lander browser build only accepts keyboard input, so coarse-pointer devices (phones, tablets) cannot thrust or rotate. We need an on-screen control surface that mirrors the existing keyboard behaviour without breaking desktop play or the level editor.

## Touch points
- `index.html`
  - Stretch the playfield to fill the viewport above the footer by measuring the HUD/tool overlays, dynamically sizing the canvas, and nudging the spawn camera so the lander remains visible on narrow screens.
  - Restyle the rotate cluster into side-by-side D-pad arrows, tighten the footer padding, and keep all buttons in a muted-outline theme that mirrors the SNES-style Start/Bomb/Thrust layout.
  - Add a fixed editor toolbar with touchable icons (Spawn, Landing, Terrain, Black Hole, Meteor), map it to the 1–5 hotkeys, and gate terrain sculpting behind the dedicated tool.
  - Align meteor motion with their warning path by switching to progress-based interpolation instead of gravity offsets so impacts land exactly on the dashed trajectory.
  - Normalize editor interactions so spawn pads, landings, black holes, and meteors drag regardless of the active tool, allow single-tap relocation for spawn/landing, enable touch drag sculpting, and fold the status/info panel behind a minimisable header.
- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Capture the expanded viewport sizing, revised HUD styling, editor toolbar, and meteor trajectory fix.

## Plan
1. **Fill the viewport** – Measure the active overlays, resize the canvas to occupy everything above the HUD/toolbars, and adjust the default spawn camera so the lander is centred on small screens.
2. **Refine the HUD** – Swap the rotate pad for side-by-side arrow buttons, tighten padding/height, and keep the outline styling consistent across Start/Bomb/Thrust.
3. **Expose editor tools** – Surface a fixed toolbar with icon buttons and 1–5 hotkeys, and require the Terrain tool for sculpting so spawn/landing/meteor interactions stay precise.
4. **Match meteor paths** – Drive meteors along their warning vector (time-based) so trails and impacts line up with the dashed telegraph.
5. **Document & sanity check** – Update `CHANGELOG.md`, verify toolbar selection works via touch/keyboard, and ensure meteors hit their warned targets while the HUD keeps the playfield visible.

## Notes
- Keep the existing keyboard listeners intact; touch input should piggyback on the same `keys` map.
- Ensure the toggle button is keyboard accessible and does not interfere with editor pointer capture.
- Account for pointer capture quirks by releasing keys on `blur` or when the HUD deactivates.
