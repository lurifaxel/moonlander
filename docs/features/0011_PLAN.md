# Feature 0011 - Mobile Touch Controls Overlay

## Context
The Moon Lander browser build only accepts keyboard input, so coarse-pointer devices (phones, tablets) cannot thrust or rotate. We need an on-screen control surface that mirrors the existing keyboard behaviour without breaking desktop play or the level editor.

## Touch points
- `index.html`
  - Rework the touch HUD markup/CSS into a fixed bottom control bar with SNES-inspired controls (D-pad rotator, start/menu pill, paired bomb/thrust buttons) and a full-screen-safe layout that reserves gameplay space.
  - Extend the virtual input bridge to accommodate non-keyboard actions (menu button), style updates, and new restart/next level UI shown after crashes or successful landings.
  - Surface a post-level overlay that mirrors the start menu so mobile players can restart or advance using touch or keyboard shortcuts (`R`/`N`).
- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Record the mobile HUD restyle and new post-level menu behaviour.

## Plan
1. **Rebuild the HUD shell** – Move the touch controls into a fixed, full-width footer that reserves vertical space for gameplay, draws a black backdrop, and arranges the D-pad/menu/action clusters per the SNES inspiration.
2. **Skin inputs & add menu action** – Style the rotator into a cross-shaped pad, convert the bomb/thrust pairing into side-by-side buttons (thrust on the right), and insert a tactile start/menu pill with pointer handling that can invoke `enterMenu()` alongside keyboard/toggle states.
3. **Show post-level options** – Introduce a reusable overlay for crash/landing outcomes with restart/next level buttons, wire it into the existing state machine, and add the `N` keyboard shortcut while keeping `R` intact.
4. **Keep modes in sync** – Ensure the HUD respects mode transitions, hides when not in gameplay, clears touch state on dismissal, and that the new overlay works with the start menu/editor flows without leaving residual classes.
5. **Document & test** – Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the refreshed HUD/post-level UX, then exercise crash/landing scenarios plus multi-touch input (rotate + thrust, bomb + rotate) across HUD visibility states.

## Notes
- Keep the existing keyboard listeners intact; touch input should piggyback on the same `keys` map.
- Ensure the toggle button is keyboard accessible and does not interfere with editor pointer capture.
- Account for pointer capture quirks by releasing keys on `blur` or when the HUD deactivates.
